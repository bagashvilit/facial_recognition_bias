# How to contribute

Here are some important resources:

  * Email:
  * Bugs? Use the GitHub Issue Tracker, unless the issue is security realted, in  which case email either of the two people above.

## Testing

Please refer to [README.md](README.md) for information about automated testing and linting.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/Allegheny-Mozilla-Fellows/facial_recognition_bias) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](pull_request_template.md). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Misinformation will generally not be accepted.

## Do you want to contribute to the MisInfoBot documentation?

You can help improve the Misinformation guides by making them more coherent, consistent, or readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, or bringing them up to date with the latest edge Rails.

To do so, make changes to MisInfoBot guides source files (located here on GitHub) or comments in source code. Then open a pull request to apply your changes to the master branch.

## Do you have questions about the source code?

Please email either Dr. Bonham-Carter or Declan Casey for any and all questions related to the Misinformation repository.
